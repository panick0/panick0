Hi, I'm panick0.

I'm just another student interested in hardware hacking and infosec.

Currently I'm learning a bunch of stuff on THM & HTB, as well as jekyll for GitHub Pages.

Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/panickzero), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/panick0), or send me an email at [panickzero@pm.me](mailto:panickzero@pm.me).
